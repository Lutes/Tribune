			        	It’s a cold Friday night in November, yet the street is busier than ever. People are crowded on the sidewalks, waiting in disorderly lines and eager to get into the coolest bars and clubs. Cigarette smoke mixes with the cold air as enthusiastic chatter rings over the noise of the traffic. People lean on window ledges, posing for the perfect selfie or Snapchat, while others devour steamies from La Belle Province or 2Chow noodles. Every so often, fire trucks, police cars, and ambulances race through the scene of revelry. Undoubtedly, boulevard St-Laurent is a staple of Montreal’s nightlife scene. It is a familiar location that holds countless memories for many students.

			        	People are in high spirit to celebrate Halloween. It is early for a night out—just shy of 10 p.m.—yet a line is already forming to get into Club École Privée, a nightclub on the intersection with Rue Milton. The lineups for clubs and bars make it difficult to navigate the narrow sidewalks of St-Laurent. It becomes an exercise, with people bumping into one another and shoulders brushing as party-goers make their way to their next destination. On one hand, this invokes a feeling of chaos, but on the other, it only enhances the feeling of closeness and camaraderie.

			        	A trio of friends are indulging in the modern practice of taking group selfies. Despite the bustle of the street, some people still find themselves drawn into the virtual world of their phones. Some take photos to create memories, while others use social media to document their whereabouts to others. The way people share events with friends has evolved with the emergence of new technologies and apps, such as Snapchat and Instagram. Taking photos and sharing it online is one way for people to feel as though they are together with all their friends in enjoying the festivities that St-Laurent has to offer.

						A man waits to cross St-Laurent on its intersection with Avenue des Pins, hoping to sell tulips to people passing by. Bars such as Bifteck or Vol de Nuit are not off-limits to these street vendors. With a hopeful countenance, the vendor approaches potential customers, some of whom are happy to purchase a gift for a companion. The business exchange is short and simple, with the vendor ultimately providing his customer with a memento of their night out.

						  A panhandler stands in an empty doorway as people pass by. Even though homelessness is not a rare sight in a metropolis such as Montreal, the juxtaposition of the lives that can be seen on St-Laurent  is striking. Most night-goers try to avoid meeting her eyes as they make their way through the street. The bright hedonistic atmosphere of the street clashes with the realism and bleakness of the scene.

						As the night winds down and people’s balance worsens and their vision blurs, many resort to greasy, unhealthy food as a form of remedy. Whether it’s from La Belle Province, le Main, or A&W, junk food is the fuel to power one’s walk home after a long night out.

						People often line up at one a.m. to get their hands on some 2Chow noodles. With a bit of luck, the waiting time will be very short; however, during peak hours, it is normal for someone to wait around 20 minutes to get their hands on the popular snack. Perhaps it’s the affordable price of $2 that makes this establishment so popular. Or maybe it’s the delicious peanut butter or teriyaki sauces noodles that makes it so desirable.
