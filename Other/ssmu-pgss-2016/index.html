                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                 I’ve been working on a few things [….] I was working on this project called a crash pad pilot for frosh. I had about 100 kids sleeping in the [Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU)] ballroom instead of going home […and we] kept some kids from driving home drunk […. I’ve been] looking at the Student-Run Cafeteria (SRC) inside and out [with VP Finance Niall Carolan] and we have dissected some of the expenses, the losses, and set up a plan of attack on how to push this forward. [The executives] are going to be a lot more hands-on [with the operation…] literally making it all student run [….] Minicourses is moving smoothly, we’ve had long conversations on how to make [it] more efficient [….] I’m going to be doing a lot more feedback surveys as well, looking at what we can do and what’s been successful in the past.

                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                  I’ve been looking at a project to get connections with the indigenous community and display indigenous artwork in our building. We have a policy on indigenous solidarity and one way to uphold this is to offer the opportunity for indigenous artists to display their work [….] I’ve reached out to the on-campus community and I’m looking to have indigenous students form a selection community [….] One of [my other] biggest focuses is going to be handling some of the construction issues.

                  A building as old as this one often has a lot of surprises […. I’m] certain that there will be building issues in my time in office. [It’s] frustrating because [I] have to drop other projects just to keep the status quo, essentially. [The executive structure] is better than before because we now have someone who can drop everything and respond quickly when we need crisis management.

                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                 So, obviously a big thing is the McGill Sexual Violence Policy [….The] student-drafted policy was rejected by the administration in April 2016, what happened then was in May the university circulated their own draft and so we spent quite a bit of the summer going back and forth with them on what that draft was, what potential there might be to make changes, and what the community consultation was going to look like [.…] We [also] hired a researcher to develop an unpaid internships policy. Specifically, we have a researcher looking at external regulatory frameworks of McGill in terms of internships that it is promoting and providing [.…But] also some kind of further advocacy within McGill and also at the provincial level for remunerated opportunities, and for better, stronger regulations around unpaid internships and the inequities associated with those.

                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                  So, there are some things I haven’t had as much of a chance to address over the summer, either intended or just because people haven’t been around — Fall Reading Week, for example. That’s something that we will probably revisit this month because the momentum on that kind of stalled in the late spring, and the summer didn’t seem to be a very good time to revisit it or get in touch with enrolment services. There’s [also] the Library Improvement Fund. So, as always we’re going to be trying to consult students actively on proposal ideas. [The fund is] a lot of money, so it’s really important that student priorities and student initiative ideas be reflected in those allocations. We’ll have a kind of a consultation period probably in October to start developing initiatives and start working with libraries. In terms of student communication, I’m hoping to push a lot of information out, but also bring a lot of information in. And so I’m going to be having some conversations with our senators and also our counsellors on how we can [improve student communication]

                  Time and resources. We have very ambitious plans and I’ve seen some good progress on a lot of things […] but we’ve had cuts to our resources, so we’ve had to make cuts to student-staff hours and things like that that are pretty essential [.…] And also, as always with this portfolio, just addressing how slow-moving the university is. I would have liked to have started on the Fall Reading Week advocacy in June […] and [now] it might happen in October.

                 [During my campaign] I spoke about [Wellness Recovery Action Programs (WRAP)] spaces in the SSMU building and making sure the clinic had enough space to run WRAP, which are group therapy sessions. We’ve been working with them and [...] hopefully their program will be expanding a little bit because of that [....] When it comes to Mental Health 101 training for faculty and professors, [...] all new faculty will be getting Mental Health 101 training [during incoming faculty orientation] and that’s happened already this year [....] [We’ve been looking] into equitable alternative governance and the different structures that are present at other universities. For SSMU, [we’re looking at how we] can be more equitable and have more voices around the table. [There are] a lot of barriers [when it comes to] council accessibility. The second piece of the research is more specific to McGill [and] how can their Board of Governors be more accessible, take more student input, and be more equitable in makeup.

                <p>What upcoming projects have you been working on?</p>
                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                  My office has been working on an executive shadowing program [called A Day in the Life]. In October, we will [offer students the chance to] spend a day or half a day with a [SSMU] executive. We want people to have more understanding of what we do here and to [allow] people who might want to run for a position to see what it’s actually like. We will be expanding to the administration as well so hopefully this month the Principal and some other people from the Board [of Governors of McGill (BoG)] will come in to shadow me for a day to help build understanding between [us and] the administration [....] Some members of the administration have asked why we don’t take a full course-load as students, there is clearly a very big misunderstanding of just how much work there is and the extent to which [our jobs] are like real jobs, not just a student position. I’ve been working with members of the BoG to build up use of the BoG as an advocacy piece. Typically the BoG has been a pretty big barrier when it comes to presidential advocacy because of how small the student perspective is there.

                <p>What challenges do you foresee this year?</p>
                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                  I see that there is strain on my office because when things affect the president’s portfolio it’s not just me–it’s the whole team. We’re short of resources here. So, when we still want to run our projects, at or past capacity, we’re going to reach those areas where there are [more resources] required than are available. However, for now I’m feeling good and excited!

                There are four major parts of the portfolio [...] External Affairs, which involves interacting with basically anybody outside McGill. This is mostly limited to Quebec student federations, like the Association for the Voice of Education in Quebec (AVEQ), where I still sit as an observer at meetings. Then, there is Political Affairs, which includes supporting the three political campaigns on campus that we are mandated to support — Divest McGill, Demilitarize McGill, and McGill Against Austerity — and also includes mobilization aid for students with independent campaigns [...]. Then, there is Community Affairs, where we’ve been working on the Community Action and Relations Endeavour (CARE) agreement, signed by the last VP External [Emily Boytinck], the Milton-Parc Citizens Committee Vice-President Hélène Brisson, and the Dean of Students [Andre Costopoulos]. It’s an agreement that highlights our relationship with the Milton-Parc community, [...] a relationship that is unique in all of Canada in that we’re very close to the Milton-Parc community and we have to maintain very close ties. [...] Finally, there is Francophone Affairs which I will be combining with Community Affairs into one committee headed by the Community Affairs Coordinator and Community Engagement Commissioner.

                  In the past, it has been difficult to find a common voice when pronouncing ourselves on political issues. We have a very diverse student body, many of whom are from other parts of the world. We should have a common voice — a voice that represents all. [When approaching divisive political issues], the main objective should be to do so responsibly. If people want to come forth with a motion, it’s not anyone’s place to tone police or to tell them what to say [...] but we will collaborate as much as possible. We’re working on helping students to draft motions outside GA [...] which is inaccessible to many students. That way we can put forward something that has been collaborated on by multiple parties, instead of coming into the [General Assembly (GA)] with irreconcilable differences.

                 The internal portfolio took a much smaller role in Frosh this year, which was great. We were able to focus solely on community relations and the administrative aspects of Frosh [...] I met with the police, [Milton-Parc Citizens Committee Vice-President] Hélène Brisson [and] did all the community relations stuff. Recently, under my portfolio is First-Year Council (FYC) [....] I’m completely restructuring it and combining aspects of the First-Year Undergraduate Network and the FYC together into one thing.

                  Besides the FYC structure update, just some more general communications initiatives. [On Sept. 6] we had a meeting with the Dean of Libraries [Colleen Cook] to talk about some new initiatives. All those library [TV] screens would be a really useful medium for us to present some information, such as ways to get involved on campus [....] Something that we were thinking of doing [on the screens] was SSMU facts [...] as a way to disseminate super useful information to students.

                <p>What have you done this summer?</p>
                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                 A lot of my activities this summer have been catching up on institutional memory. There is a lot of turnover in student government. I’ve had to catch up on both the [Post-Graduate Students’ Society (PGSS)] side and the business side, as the [Secretary-General] is responsible both for Society activities as well as for the [Thomson House] business side. I’ve also been doing a lot of orientation activities to make PGSS as accessible for students as possible and [to] get members more involved. Orientation Week is very important because many graduate students get very involved in their research so engagement in the society often takes a back seat. The quicker we can engage them the more involved they’ll be.

                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                  I’ve been working on sexual violence/assault policy and consent campaigns. That is definitely one of my priorities as Sec-Gen. It’s been two years of the working group drafting a policy for McGill so I think it’s time for an ambitious policy to be put forward [....] I’ve also been working with environment officers on putting together a proposal for how McGill can go carbon neutral. As a society we need to move towards goals of carbon neutrality, including carbon offsets. We want to move from a vision for sustainability to something much more concrete and defined.

                <p>What challenges do you foresee this year?</p>
                <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">
                  I would have to say [not enough] time. A major challenge both for student societies and the administration is how to make decisions that affect a giant organization like McGill. There are so many angles we need to consider when making any decisions and one of the biggest challenges for me is making sure that our decisions serve the best interests of the university and students.

                 Three words. Orientation. Orientation. Orientation [....] Sahil Kumar, the previous Internal Affairs Officer, basically organized the first postgraduate orientation last year that is in the same format that is right now. It’s similar to undergraduate orientation where we had social activities for a week, or even more than a week, planned for orientation.

                This year we [blew up] orientation and [made] it bigger, better, more inclusive, more options for students to choose from because, in comparison to undergraduate Froshes, our students don’t want a package deal, they want to be able to pick and choose the events they like. We are also focusing more on accessibility, more events that are free events that everybody can participate in.

One of these empowerment panels is about feminism in the 21st century, and racialized sexism.

                  One thing I’ll continue to advocate for is funding for graduate students. One issue [...] is you have Quebec residents, out of province, and international fees, they are all different. You might think that there are funding packages for grad students that take that into account, I just learned there is one program at least that does that, but not all of them do [....] I know that [this is something that] Josephine [Nalbantoglu], the Dean of Graduate Students, cares about, too. So I hope with her and the Council on [Graduate] Studies to at least continue pushing towards a more equitable funding packages.
